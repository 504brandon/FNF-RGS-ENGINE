if you want the base songs & weeks to go with your weeks & songs,
put "freeplaySonglist" and "weekList in [MOD-FOLDER]/_append/data!
otherwise put them in [MOD-FOLDER]/data.


FOR LUA SCRIPTING:
you import non included classes through `script:import("CLASS-PATH", "OPTIONAL-CLASS-NAME")`
you can access the script's "parent" through `script.parent` or just `parent`.

IF YOU ARE CALLING A HAXE FUNCTION THROUGH LUA, YOU HAVE TO:
  1 (RECOMMENDED) - Call it with ":" (Ex: object:func(param1, param2))
  2 - Include the object as a parameter. (Ex: object.func(object, param1, param2))
im currently working on making it so you dont have to do those work arounds, so please stay patient.

if you want the base songs & weeks to go with your weeks & songs,
put your data files in [MOD-FOLDER]/_append/data!
otherwise put it in [MOD-FOLDER]/data.


FOR LUA SCRIPTING:
you import non included classes through `script:import("CLASS-PATH", "OPTIONAL-CLASS-NAME")`
you can access the script's "parent" through `script.parent` or just `parent`.

IF YOU ARE CALLING A HAXE FUNCTION THROUGH LUA, YOU HAVE TO:
  1 (RECOMMENDED) - Call it with ":" (Ex: object:func(params))
  2 - Include the object as a parameter. (Ex: object.func(object, params))
im currently working on making it so you dont have to do those work arounds, so please stay patient.

AND FUNCTIONS ARE CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED IN TABLES.
if you are trying to set a tweens complete function,
please do `tween.onComplete = func` instead.
